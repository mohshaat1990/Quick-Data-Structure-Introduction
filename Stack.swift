/*
 the stack is simple Data Structure You can only push to add a new element to the top of the stack, pop to remove the element from the top, and peek at the top element without popping it off.
 
 A stack gives you a LIFO or last-in-first-out order
 
 should I use a Linked List in implement Stack?
 
 Linked lists have several advantages over arrays. Elements can be inserted into linked lists indefinitely, while an array will eventually either fill up or need to be resized, an expensive operation that may not even be possible if memory is fragmented. Similarly, an array from which many elements are removed may become wastefully empty or need to be made smaller.
 
 On the other hand, arrays allow random access, while linked lists allow only sequential access to elements. Singly-linked lists, in fact, can only be traversed in one direction. This makes linked lists unsuitable for applications where it's useful to look up an element by its index quickly, such as heapsort. Sequential access on arrays is also faster than on linked lists on many machines due to the locality of reference and data caches. Linked lists receive almost no benefit from the cache.
 
 Another disadvantage of linked lists is the extra storage needed for references, which often makes them impractical for lists of small data items such as characters or boolean values. It can also be slow, and with a na√Øve allocator, wasteful, to allocate memory separately for each new element, a problem generally solved using memory pools.
